The `Games` folder is where the Game Creator stores finished games, tools, and systems. The `Sandbox` folder is for any game the engine is currently running, or you are editing. This directory is persistent and only replaced when you load a new game. Since this folder is persistent, you to continue working on a game across different sessions. The `Lib` folder contains Lua scripts shared across different games or tools. `Trash` contains files that ready to be deleted.
