# What is Pixel Vision 8

Pixel Vision 8's core philosophy is to teach retro game development with streamlined workflows. It enables designing games around limited resolutions, colors, sprites, sound and memory. It is ideal for game jams, prototyping ideas or having fun. 

PV8 is also a platform that standardizes 8-bit fantasy console limitations built on top of the open source [Pixel Vision SDK](http://pixelvisionsdk.com). Developers can customize these restrictions to match actual legacy hardware or create something new. The challenge of working within these confines forces creativity and limits the scope. Pixel Vision 8 creations are expressions of ingenuity that rise above their limitations.
